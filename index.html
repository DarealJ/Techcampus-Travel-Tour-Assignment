<p>I went to the job venue tp take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such great job was done by Joel Dare.</p>
<p>He was a man of vast experience in renewable energy</p>
<p>the park had beautiful sceneries thought it needs more security because of the Ojota opportunists. It requires maintenance too. But overall I love it</p>
